      <p class= "A">THE OTHERWORDLY AURORA</p><p>borwlia, or northern lights, begin high in the Earth's atmosphere--at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles - when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the Earth's magnetic field. The results is a colorful, dancing lightshow.
      <p>The first time I filmed an aurora was from an icebreaker near Antarctica. Luckily, there are much more accesible places if you'd like to take in these light shows yourself. for the best seats to this celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitdue above 55 degrees and low light pollution. Find your magnetic latiude on NOAA and here.</p>
     <p>In the polar latiudes, auroras can appera on any darknight.Long winter nights are good but not necessarily the best time. Near equinoxes in March and september, and Earth's magnetic field lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora season! I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasants temperatures in polar latitudes.Find the dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app</p>
