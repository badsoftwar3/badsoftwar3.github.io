<br>
<p><i>Iceland</i> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist. Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.

</figcaption>
</figure >
<p class ="para2">The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora, and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From september to april, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.<br>The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p class = "para3">When making a trip to Iceland, it hard not to pat special attention to the country's namesake-namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier.Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Sólheimajökull and Svinafellsjokull glaciers in the south of Iceland,to which day trips are offered from reykjavik(and Skaftafell).
